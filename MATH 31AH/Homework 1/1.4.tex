\subsection{$S = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : xy = 0\}$ and $(x, y) \star (x', y') = (x+x', y+y')$}
This function is not well defined since $x = (1,0)$ and $y =(0,1)$ does not have $xy = 0$.

\subsection{$S = \mathbb{R}$ and $x \star y = \frac{x}{y^2+1}$}
This function is well-defined since the square of a real number plus 1 cannot be zero.

\subsection{$S = \mathbb{C}$ and $x \star y = \frac{x}{y^2+1}$}
This function is not well-defined since for $y = i$, there will be a divide by zero error.
