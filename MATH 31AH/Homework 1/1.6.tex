\section{Characteristic of a field}
If $char(\mathbb{F}) = n > 0$ then $n$ is prime.
\begin{proof} 
    Assume that $n$ is not prime. 
    This means that there exists numbers $1 < a \leq b < n$ such that $ab = n$.
    Since $\overbrace{1+1+...+1}^n = 0$, and
    $ab = n$
    we have that
    $\overbrace{1+1+...+1}^\text{ab} = 0$ which implies
    $ab = 0$.
    Since $1 < a \leq b < n$, $ab \neq 0$ by problem 5, 
    which contradicts $ab = 0$.
    Therefore n must be prime.
\end{proof}
