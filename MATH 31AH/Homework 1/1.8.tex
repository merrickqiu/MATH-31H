\section{A non-field}
\begin{proof} $\mathbb{F}^2$ with "coordinate-wise" arithmetic is not a field.

    A field must have a multiplicative inverse for every nonzero element.
    Let $x = (0, a)$ where a is an arbitrary nonzero element. 
    Since the x is not the zero element, it must have a multiplicative inverse.
    Since the first element of x is 0, it does not have a multiplicative inverse,
    and so the multiplicative inverse of x does not have a valid first element.
    This means that x does not have a multiplicative inverse 
    under "coordinate-wise" arithmetic".
    Therefore, $\mathbb{F}^2$ is not a field.
\end{proof}
