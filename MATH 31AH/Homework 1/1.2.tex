\section{Vectors on a circle}
There exists elements $v, s \in S$ such that $v + w \in S$ where S is the unit circle.
\begin{proof} 
    Let $v = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ and $w = (\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$. 
    $(\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = (\frac{1}{2})^2 + (-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = 1$ so
    v and w are in S.
    v+w = (1, 0), which is in S. 
    Therefore, there exists vectors in the unit circle that add to another vector in the unit circle.
\end{proof}
