\section{A four-element field?}
\begin{proof} Field S, a four element field with arithmetic modulo 4, does not exist.

    A field must have a multiplicative inverse for every element in it.
    The element 2 in set S does not have a multiplicative inverse since
    $0 \cdot 2 = 0$,
    $1 \cdot 2 = 2$,
    $2 \cdot 2 = 0$, and
    $3 \cdot 2 = 2$.
    Therefore S is not a field.
\end{proof}
