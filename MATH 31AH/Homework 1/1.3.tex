\section{Ill-defined functions}
\subsection{$f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and $f(z) = \frac{1}{z^2+3}$}
The function is not well-definied when z = $\sqrt{3}i$ because of a divide by zero error.

\subsection{$g: \mathbb{Q} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ and $g(\frac{a}{b}) = a-b$}
The function is not well-defined since each rational number can be expressed with many different combinations of numerators and denominators.

\subsection{$h: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ and $h(x, y) = y$}
The function is not well-defined since the value of $h(0, -1)$ is -1, which is negative and not in the codomain of $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$.
