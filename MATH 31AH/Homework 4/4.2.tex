\section{Linear maps and spanning}
\begin{proof} $T(S) := \{T(v):v \in S\}$ spans $Image(T)$.\gap

    Since $Image(T) := \{T(w):w \in V\}$, 
    we must show that every $T(w)$ 
    can be written as a linear combination of $T(v)$.\gap

    Let $v_1,v_2,...,v_n$ be vectors in $T(S)$
    and $c_1,c_2,...,c_n$ be scalars.
    We have that
    \begin{align*}
        T(w) 
        &= T(c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n)\\ 
        &= c_1T(v_1) + c_2T(v_2) + ... + c_nT(v_n)
    \end{align*}

    Therefore, $T(S)$ spans $Image(T)$ 
    since any arbitrary $T(w)$ can be written as
    a linear combination of vectors in $T(S)$.
\end{proof}
