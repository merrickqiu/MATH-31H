\section{Inverses of linear maps}
\begin{proof} The inverse of a linear transformation $T$ is also linear.\gap

    Since $T$ is linear and additivity is preserved, we have that
    \begin{align*}
        T(v_1 + v_2) 
        &= T(v_1) + T(v_2) \\
        &= w_1 + w_2
    \end{align*}

    From this, we have that
    $T\inv(w_1) = v_1$,
    $T\inv(w_2) = v_2$, and
    $T\inv(w_1 + w_2) = v_1 + v_2$.
    Therefore, we have that
    \begin{align*}
        T\inv(w_1 + w_2) 
        &= v_1 + v_2 \\
        &= T\inv(w_1) + T\inv(w_2)
    \end{align*}

    Since $T$ is linear and scalar multiplication is preserved, 
    we have that 
    \begin{align*}
        T(cv) 
        &= cT(v) \\
        &= cw
    \end{align*}. 
    From this, we have that $T\inv(cw) = cv$ and $T\inv(w) = v$.
    Therefore, 
    $T\inv(cw) = cv = cT\inv(w)$.
    Since addition and scalar multiplication are preserved,
    $T\inv$ is a linear transformation.
