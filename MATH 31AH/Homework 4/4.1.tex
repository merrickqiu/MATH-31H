\section{Projections}

\begin{proof}$P_v$ is linear.\gap

    $P_v$ preserves vector addition since
    \begin{align*}
        P_v((v,w)+(v',w')) 
        &= P_v(v+v',w+w')\\ 
        &= v+v'\\
        &= P_v(v,w) + P_v(v',w').
    \end{align*}

    $P_v$ also preserves scalar multiplication since
    \begin{align*}
        P_v(c(v,w)) 
        &= P_v(cv,cw)\\ 
        &= cv\\
        &= cP_v(v,w).
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, $P_V$ is a linear map.
\end{proof}

$P_v$ is always surjective since every element $v \in V$
is mapped onto by $(v,0)$.
$P_v$ is only injective when the size of $W$ is 1.
If the size of $W$ is greater than 1, 
then multiple tuples can be projected into $V$.
