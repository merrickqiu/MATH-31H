\section*{Problem 1}
If the image and kernel of a transformation are the same, 
then that means that taking the transformation twice will result in zero.
If $T$ is the derivative with $V$ being polynomials of degree one or less,
then $\text{Image}(T) = \text{Kernel}(T)$ 
since the second derivative of degree one polynomials is zero.
