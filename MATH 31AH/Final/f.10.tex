\section*{Problem 10}
Due to the rank-nullity theorem,
$\dim(\hom(V,W) \otimes V) = \dim(\ker(\varphi)) + \dim(\text{image}(\varphi))$
We have that $\dim(\hom(V,W) \otimes V) = (4 \cdot 5) \cdot 4= 80$.
$\varphi$ is also surjective because for every $w \in W$,
for some $v \neq 0$,
there exists a transformation $T$ such that
$T(v) = w$, so there exists some $T \otimes v$ with
$\varphi(T \otimes v) = w$.
Therefore $\dim(\text{image}(\varphi)) = \dim(W) = 5$.
Therefore, $\dim(\ker(\varphi)) = 80 - 5 = 75$.
