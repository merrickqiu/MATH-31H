\section*{Problem 8}
This statement is false, since vectors in the form $v \otimes w$
only includes simple tensors.
Let $t \in \reals^2 \otimes \reals^2$ be a tensor with 
$t = e_1 \otimes e_2 + e_2 \otimes e_1$, where $e_1,e_2$ 
are the standard basis vectors of $\reals^2$.
If it is expressable in the form $v \otimes w$,
then
\begin{align*}
    (e_1 \otimes e_2) + (e_2 \otimes e_1)
    &= (ae_1 + be_2) \otimes (ce_1 + de_2)\\
    &= ac(e_1 \otimes e_1) + ad(e_1 \otimes e_2) 
    + bc(e_2 \otimes e_1) + bd(e_2 \otimes e_2)
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
    & ac = 0\\
    & ad = 1\\
    & bc = 1\\
    & bd = 0
\end{align*}

This is impossible since the second equation implies $a$ is nonzero
and the third equation implies that $c$ is nonzero,
but then $ac = 0$ would be impossible.
This is a contradiction, so there exists tensors that cannot be 
written in the form $v \otimes w$.
