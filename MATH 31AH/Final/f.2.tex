\section*{Problem 2}
Since $\mathbb{F}_3^6$ has 6 dimensions and
$\mathbb{F}_3^5$ has 5 dimensions,
all linear transformations $T: \mathbb{F}_3^6 \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_3^5$
can be represented by $5 \times 6$ matricies with elements in $\mathbb{F}_3$.
Therefore, there are $5 \times 6 \times 3 = 90$ different transformations.
