\section{Lines in the complex plane.}
$W_c$ is only a vector space if and only if $c=0$.
\begin{proof}
    Addition in $W_0$ is closed since
    $(x+0i) + (y+0i) = x+y + 0i \in W_0$.
    Scalar multiplication in $W_0$ is closed since
    $\lambda \cdot (y+0i) = \lambda y + 0i \in W_0$.
    Let c be any nonzero real number.
    Addition in $W_c$ is not closed since
    $(x+ic) + (y+ic) = x+y + i(2c) \not\in W_c$
    and $2c \neq c$.\gap

    Since $W_c$ is a vector space when $c=0$,
    and $W_c$ is not a vector space otherwise,
    $W_c$ is only a vector space if and only if $c=0$.
\end{proof}
