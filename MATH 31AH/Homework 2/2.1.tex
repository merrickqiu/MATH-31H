\section{A vector space?}
$V$ is not a vector space because the additive inverse does not exist.
The zero element is $(b,0)$ since for any vector $v$,
$v + (b,0) = v$.
Let $v$ be a vector $(a, x)$ with $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
Assume $-v$ exists.
This would mean $v + (-v) = (b,0)$.
However, since the first element of $v$ is $a$,
the first element of $v + (-v)$ must be $a$.
Therefore, the additive inverse does not exist for every element in $V$,
 and $V$ is not a vector space.
