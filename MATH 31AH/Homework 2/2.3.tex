\section{Differentiable functions.}
\subsection{$U$ is a subspace of $V$.}
\begin{proof}
    The zero function, $f(x) = 0)$ is in $U$.
    Addition in $U$ is closed since
    $(f+g)(3) = 0 = 0 + 0 = f(3) + g(3)$. 
    Scalar multiplication in $U$ is closed since
    $(\lambda \cdot g)(3) = \lambda \cdot g(3) = \lambda \cdot 0 = 0$.
    Since $U$ is a subset of $V$, $U$ is a subspace of $V$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{$W$ is not a subspace of $V$.}
\begin{proof}
    Addition in $W$ is not closed since
    $(f+g)(3) = 7 \neq 14 = f(3) + g(3)$.
    Therefore, $W$ is not a subspace of $V$.
\end{proof}
