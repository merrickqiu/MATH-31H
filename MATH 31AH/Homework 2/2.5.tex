\section{Eventually zero sequences}
W is a subspace of V
\begin{proof}
    The zero sequence is in W.
    Addition in W is closed since for any $a,b \in W$,
    u+w is eventually zero at $max(\{N_a, N_b\})$.
    This is because for any $n > N_a$ and $n > N_b$,
    $a_n = 0$ and $b_n = 0$.
    This implies that $(a+b)_n = 0$,
    so $a+b \in W$. \gap

    Multiplication in W is closed since 
    for any $a \in W$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$,
    $\lambda a$ is eventually zero at $N_a$.
    This is because for any $n > N_a$,
    $a_n = 0$.
    This implies that $(\lambda a)_n = 0$
    so $\lambda a \in W$. \gap

    Since $W \subseteq V$, and 
    addition and multiplication is closed under $W$,
    $W$ is a subspace of $V$.
\end{proof}
