\section{Number of solutions to $\mathbb{F}_2$ (Optional).}
Let the degrees of freedom of the system of equations be $a$.
For each degree of freedom, there is a variable that can either be 0 or 1.
There are two possible elements for each variable, so
the total number of possible solutions is thus $2^a$.
