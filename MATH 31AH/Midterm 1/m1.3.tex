\section{Problem 3}

$Hom(V_5, V_3)$ has dimension 24.
A polynomial of degree $n$ has $n+1$ terms and has $n+1$ dimensions.
Therefore, $V_5$ has 6 dimensions
and $V_3$ has 4 dimensions.
Since the dimension of a linear transformation is the
product of the dimension of the domain and the codomain,
$Hom(V_5, V_3)$ has dimension $6 \cdot 4 = 24$.
