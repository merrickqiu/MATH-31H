\section{Invertible matrices}
The matrix is is invertible if all the rows are linearly independent.
There are $5^3 - 1$ choices for the first row since the first row canot be zero.
There are $5^3 - 5$ choices for the second row 
since the second row cannot be a scalar multiple(which there are five of) of the first row.
There are $5^3 - 5^2$ choices for the third row since the third row cannot be a linear
combination of the first two rows. 
Multiplying all these possible permutations yields $(5^3-1)(5^3-5)(5^3-5^2)$
