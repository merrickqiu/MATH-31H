\section{Homogenous systems}
\begin{proof}The solution set of a homogeneous system is a subspace of $\mathbb{F}^n$.\gap

    Let $x$ and $y$ be solutions to the homogeneous system $Ax=0$.
    This implies that for every row $i$, 
    $a_{i1}x_1 + a_{i2}x_2 + ... + a_{in}x_n = 0$ (or $Ax=0$) and 
    $a_{i1}y_1 + a_{i2}y_2 + ... + a_{in}y_n = 0$ (or $Ay=0$).
    Adding these two equations together implies that
    $a_{i1}(x_1+y_1) + a_{i2}(x_2+y_2) + ... + a_{in}(x_n+y_n) = 0$ (or $A(x+y)=0$)
    for every row $i$, implying that $x+y$ is also a solution to the homogeneous system.
    Therefore, the solution set of a homogeneous system is closed under addition.\gap
    
    Let $x$ be a solution to the homogeneous system $Ax=0$, and 
    let $c \in \mathbb{F}$ be a scalar.
    This implies that for every row $i$,
    $a_{i1}x_1 + a_{i2}x_2 + ... + a_{in}x_n = 0$ (or $Ax=0$).
    Multiplying this equation by c yields
    $a_{i1}(cx_1) + a_{i2}(cx_2) + ... + a_{in}(cx_n) = 0$ (or $A(cx)=0$)
    for every row $i$, implying that $cx$ is also a solution to the homogeneous ystem.
    Therefore, the solution set of a homogeneous system is closed under scalar multiplication.\gap

    Since solutions of $Ax=0$ is a member of $\mathbb{F}^n$
    and addition and scalar multiplication are closed,
    the solution set of a homogeneous system is a subspace of $\mathbb{F}^n$.
