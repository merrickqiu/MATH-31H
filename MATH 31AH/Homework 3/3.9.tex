\section{Making a $\mathbb{F}_2$-vector space(Optional)}
$V$ can be thought of as isomorphic to an $n+1$ dimension vector space of $\mathbb{F}_2$
where each vector-index indicates the presense or absense of the number of the index in the set.
Addition can be thought of as "cancelling out" indexes where both vectors have a 1 since
$1+1=0$ in $\mathbb{F}_2$.
Scalar multiplication can be defined as returning the empty set if the scalar is 0,
and returning the set if the scalar is 1 in order to complete the isomorphism.
