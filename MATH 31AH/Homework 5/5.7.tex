\begin{proof}A counterclockwise rotation has $\det(T) = 1$.\gap

    A counterclockwise rotation in $\mathbb{R}^2$
    by $\theta$ takes the form
    $\begin{bmatrix}
        \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta)\\
        \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
    \end{bmatrix}.$
    The determinant of a 2D rotation matrix matrix is equal to
    \begin{align}
        \det(T)
        &= \cos(\theta)\cos(\theta)-(-\sin(\theta))(\sin(\theta))\\
        &= \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta)\\
        &= 1
    \end{align}
    Therefore, $\det(T) = 1$.
\end{proof}
    
\begin{proof} A reflection across a line has $\det(T) = -1$.\gap

    Reflecting a vector across a line that is $\theta$ 
    counterclockwise of the x-axis is equivalent to rotating 
    the vector by $-\theta$, 
    reflecting across the x-axis,
    then rotating the vector by $\theta$.
    The determinant for a rotation matrix is 1.
    The matrix for negating the y-component is
    $F =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0\\
        0 & -1
    \end{bmatrix}$, so
    the determinant of reflecting across the x-axis
    is $1(-1) - 0(0) = -1$.
    If $R$ is the matrix that rotates by $\theta$,
    then the determinant of the matrix 
    that reflection across a line is
    \begin{align}
        \det(T)
        &= \det(RTR\inv)\\
        &= \det(R)\det(F)\det(R\inv)\\
        &= 1(-1)(1)\\
        &= -1
    \end{align}
    Therefore, $\det T = -1$.
\end{proof}
