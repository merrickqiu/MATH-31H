\section{Determinants and transposition}

\begin{proof} $\det A = \det A^T$\gap

    If $A$ is not invertible, then $A^T$ is not invertible, 
    and $\det A = \det A^T = 0$.
    If $A$ is invertible, then it can be written 
    as a product of elementary matrices, 
    $A = E_1E_2...E_n$.
    Since $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$,
    $A^T = (E_1E_2...E_n)^T = E_n^T...E_2^TE_1^T$.
    Since the transpose of an elementary matrix 
    has the same determinant and
    $\det(AE) = \det(A)\det(E)$, 
    we have that
    \begin{align}
        \det(A) 
        &= \det(E_1E_2...E_n)\\
        &= \det(E_1)\det(E_2)...\det(E_n)\\
        &= \det(E_n)...\det(E_2)\det(E_1)\\
        &= \det(E_n^T)...\det(E_2^T)\det(E_1^T)\\
        &= \det(E_n^T...E_2^T E_1^T)\\
        &= \det(A^T)
    \end{align}
    Therefore, $\det A = \det A^T$.
\end{proof}
