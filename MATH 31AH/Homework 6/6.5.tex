\section{Direct sums and diagonalizability}
\begin{proof} 
    If $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ or $U$,
    then $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T \oplus U$\gap
    
    If $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ and
    $v \in T$ is the corresponding eigenvector,
    then the corresponding eigenvector in $T \oplus U$
    with eigenvalue $\lambda$
    would be $(v, 0)$ since
    \begin{align}
        (T \oplus U)(v, 0)
        &= (T(v), U(0)) \\
        &= (\lambda v, 0)\\
        &= \lambda(v, 0)
    \end{align}
    
    Similarly, if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $U$ and
    $w \in U$ is the corresponding eigenvector,
    then the corresponding eigenvector in $T \oplus U$
    with eigenvalue $\lambda$
    would be $(0, w)$ since
    \begin{align}
        (T \oplus U)(0, w)
        &= (T(0), U(w)) \\
        &= (0, \lambda w)\\
        &= \lambda(0, w)
    \end{align}
    Therefore, if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ or $U$,
    then $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T \oplus U$
\end{proof}

\begin{proof} If $T$ and $U$ are diagonalizable, then $T \oplus U$ is diagonalizable. \gap
    
    Let $V$ be $m$ dimensional and let $W$ be $n$ dimensional.
    Since $T$ and $U$ are both diagonalizable, 
    they have $m$ and $n$ eigenvalues respectivly. \gap

    Since every eigenvalue of $T$ or $U$ is an eigenvalue of $T \oplus U$,
    $T \oplus U$ has $m+n$ eigenvalues.
    Since $T \oplus U$ has $m+n$ dimensions and $m+n$ eigenvalues,
    $T \oplus U$ is diagonalizable.
