\section{Symmetric and Orthogonal}
\begin{proof} Symmetric matrices are an $\real$-vector space while orthogonal matrices are not.\gap

    Symmetric matrices are an $\real$-vector space since
    the zero matrix is symmetric and
    \[
        A + B
        = A^T + B^T
        = (A+B)^T
    \]
    \[
        cA
        =cA^T
        =(cA)^T
    \]

    Symmetric matricies have dimension equal to the number
    of upper triangular entries.
    \[
        \dim A = 1 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
    \]

    Orthogonal matricies do not form a vector space
    since the zero matrix is not orthogonal.
    Addition is also not closed since the identity matrix is orthogonal, 
    but the sum of the identity matrix with itself is not orthogonal.
\end{proof}
