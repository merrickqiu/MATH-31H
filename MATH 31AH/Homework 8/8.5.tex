\section{Matrix Tensor Product}

\begin{proof}$(A \otimes B) \cdot (C \otimes D) = (AC)\otimes (BD)$\gap

    The $ij$th block of $(A \otimes B) \cdot (C \otimes D)$ is
    \[
        \sum_{k=1}^n (a_{ik}B) (c_{kj} D) = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik} c_{kj} BD
    \]

    The $ij$th block of $(AC)\otimes (BD)$ is
    \[
        (\sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik} c_{kj}) BD = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik} c_{kj} BD
    \]
    Since both expressions result in the same summation, they are equal.
\end{proof}
