\section{Determinants and Tensors}

\begin{proof} $\psi$ is well defined.\gap

    Let $\varphi: V \times ... \times V \rightarrow \field$ 
    be a linear map with $\varphi(v_1,...,v_n) = \det(v_1 ... v_n)$.
    Since the determinant is multilinear, $\varphi$ is multilinear.
    By the universal property of tensor spaces,
    $\psi: V \otimes ... \otimes V \rightarrow \field$ is well-defined
    with $\psi(v_1 \otimes ... \otimes v_n) := \varphi(v_1,...,v_n) = \det(v_1 ... v_n)$.
\end{proof}
