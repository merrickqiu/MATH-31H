\section{Matrix Direct Sum}

If A is a $m \times n$ matrix and B is a $p \times q$ matrix,
then the first m entries of $(A \oplus B)x$ are $Ax_{1:n}$ 
and the last p entries of $(A \oplus B)x$ are $Bx_{n+1:q}$. 
This "segregates" the linear transformations of $A$ and $B$
to only acting on the first $n$ entires and last $q$ entries
in the same way that $T$ only acts on $v$ and $T'$ only acts on $v'$
in $T \oplus T'$.
