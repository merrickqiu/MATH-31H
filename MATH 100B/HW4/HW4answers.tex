\section*{Problem 1}
We can reproduce Euclids proof that $\mathbb{Z}$ has infinitely many primes to show that 
$F[x]$ has infinitely many monic irreducible polynomials.
Suppose that there were only a finite number of monic irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$, say $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. 
Then consider the polynomial $p_{n+1} = p_1p_2\cdots p_n + 1$ which is also a monic polynomial.
Since $p_{n+1}$ is not divisible by any of the $p_i$, it must be irreducible.

Therefore the monic irreducible polynomials are not given by $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ which is a contradiction.
Therefore there must be a infinite number of monic irreducible polynomials.
Since the maximal ideals of $F[x]$ are the principal ideals generated by the monic irreducible polynomials,
there are also an infinite number of maximal ideals.

\section*{Problem 2}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item This is simply proving Fermats Little theorem, which we can do by looking at the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}_p^\times$.
	For any element $a \in \mathbb{F}_p^\times$, the order give by $k$ must divide $p-1$ by Lagrange's theorem.
	If $p-1 = kn$ for some $n$ then $a^{p-1}-1 = a^{kn}-1 = (a^k)^n -1 = 1-1 = 0$.
	Therefore all elements in $\mathbb{F}_p^\times$ are roots of $f(x)$.
	\item Since every nonzero element of $\mathbb{F}_p$ is a root of $f(x)$,
	we can write $f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)\ldots(x-(p-1))g(x)$ for some polynomial $g(x)$.
	However in order for the leading coefficients and degrees of the left and right hand side to match,
	$g(x) = 1$ so we can simply write $f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)\ldots(x-(p-1))$.
	\item The constant term of $f(x)$ is $-1$ and the constant term of the right hand side is 
	the product $(p-1)!$ modulo p so it must be that $(p-1)! \equiv -1 \mod p$. 
\end{enumerate}
\newpage 

\section*{Problem 3}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $f(x) \in R$ with leading coefficient $a$ and $g(x)$ has leading coefficient $b$.
	If we set $f(x) - \frac{a}{b}g(x) = r(x)$ then $\deg r < \deg g$ and $f(x) = r(x) + \frac{a}{b}g(x)$.
	This representation is unique since if $f(x) = r(x) + \frac{a}{b}g(x) = s(x) + cg(x)$ with $\deg s < \deg g$ and $c \neq \frac{a}{b}$,
	then that would imply that $r(x) - s(x) = (c-\frac{a}{b})g(x)$, 
	but this is a contradiction since the degrees of the left and right hand side do not match.
	\item Each element of $R$ corresponds to a coset $r(x) + (g(x))$ where $r(x)$ has degree $n-1$.
	Since $r(x)$ has $n$ different coefficients and each of these coefficients can take on $p$ different values,
	there are in total $p^n$ different cosets in $\mathbb{F}_p[x]/(g(x))$.
\end{enumerate}
\newpage 

\section*{Problem 4}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item By the previous problem we have that $E$ has a total of $3^2 = 9$ elements. 
	It is a field because it is the quotient of a polynomial ring by an irreducible polynomial.
	\item $E^\times$ is cyclic since $x+1$ generates it.$(x+1)^2 = 2x$, $(x+1)^4 = 2$, and $(x+1)^8 = 1$.
	\item $\mathbb{F}_3[x]/(x^3+1)$ is a field with 27 elements.
